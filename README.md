# A-Multiple-Feature-Reuse-Network-to-Extract-Buildings-From-Remote-Sensing-Imagery
Python implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in paper

This repository includes functions to preprocess the input images and their respective polygons so as to create the 
input image patches and mask patches to be used for model training. The main CNN used here is the 56 - convolutional - layers network 
implemented in the paper 'A Multiple - Feature Reuse Network to Extract Buildings from Remote Sensing Imagery' by Lin L., Liang J.,
Weng M., Zhu H. (2018)
